# SpaceAppChallenge---StellarMinds

A web application of our solar system in an Orrery. The project addresses the challenges by demonstrating the behaviors and of celestial bodies and the sun through an interactive Orrery. This is important as the diagram helps users visualize dynamic and complex astronomical concepts regarding Heliophysics.

# Project Details

Starting the project, you are introduced with the immediate diagram of the Orrery of our solar system. you are able to see all the celestial bodies and their orbit around the sun. It provides a good visualization to see how current and future interactions of the celestial bodies in our solar system behave. You are able to click a legend to see what each celestial body is and clicking on each celestial body pops up an infobox that explains them. If further information is wanted, you are able to ask the provided AI assistant on any information regarding our solar system. We hope to provide a better understanding of Heliophysics.

# Technology Used

The tools we used on our project are JavaScript as our base, HTML and CSS for format and styling, OpenAI API for the Ai assistant, Fetch API for handling request, Canvas API to animate the revolutions for our project, and Azure for server hosting and API key encryptions through Azure key vault.

# What's next for StellarMinds

There were many features that we could not implement due to time constraint. Here are a few:

- Orrery simulation presented at real time with regards to our Solar system
- Implement AI to predict future behavior and interactions on the simulation
- Futher going indepth on other celestial bodies and factors such as NEAs, NECs, PHAs, Solar Flares, and Magnetic Fields
- 3D models of the Orrery simulation
- Realistic physics regarding the orbits of the celestial bodies
- Making a more accurate model in regards to sizing, orbiting speed, orbital trailing
